xacrodoc
========

xacrodoc is a tool for compiling `xacro <https://github.com/ros/xacro>`_ files
to plain URDF files or Mujoco MJCF files from within Python code or via the
command line. It is fully functional whether ROS is installed on the system or
not.

xacrodoc requires at least Python 3.8. Note that ROS *does not* need to be
installed on the system, but xacrodoc will also use its infrastructure to look
for packages if it is available.

Installation instructions and usage examples can be found `here
<https://github.com/adamheins/xacrodoc>`_, while the class and function
reference can be found below.
